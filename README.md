### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Happy Moments for Different People
+ This project is conducted by [Chun Zhai]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] In this project, I conduct data analysis and visualization on different variables, including age, gender, marital status and country. Then I find that country is the variable I am most interested in (since there are so many countries in this data set and each country corresponds to various answers). I decide to study on the relaionships among country, original_hm and reflection_period. Finally, I discover that there could be some hidden patterns for the answers after spending time exploring them on different countries.
